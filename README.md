## Some Details

- Classic Evolutionary Programming (CEP) uses a Gaussian and Fast Evolutionary Programming (FEP) uses a Cauchy distribution for mutation.
- Set values to bounds for points which are out of bounds.
- A fixed lower bound is set for step-size.
- The individual is mutated first then mutate the step-size.

The programs will also output formatted Latex table for results and plots of evolutionary curves.


## Lab 4: Explore how search operators and implementation details affect an EA’s performance.

### Task
- We have seen how the performance of an EA changes when using a Cauchy, instead of Gaussian, to sample random perturbation to generate offspring.
- There are many details which affect an EA's performance:
  - Distributions used to sample random perturbation to generate offspring (cf. pages 8-10, 37 of the slides for Lecture 4)
  - Techniques for handle points out of bounds
  - Set a fix / an adaptive lower bound for $\eta$ or not (cf. pages 39-40 of the slides for Lecture 4)
  - Mutate $\x$ first or mutate $\eta$ first  (cf. Eqs. (2) and (3) on page 9 of the slides for Lecture 4)
  - Mix search biases by self-adaptation (cf. pages 34-36 of the slides for Lecture 4)
  
  (More details can be found in the slides for Lecture 4!)

In this lab, we will exxplore how **search operators** and **implementation details** affect an EA's performance.

### Results and Discussion (to be filled by students)
**Attention: Repeat fewer times or use a smaller number of generations as the experiments will run long ...**

1. Use Levy Distribution to sample random perturbation to generate offspring (蒋如意)

TODO

2. When a point is outside of bounds, re-sample it till being inside (谭浩)

running times = 50

population size = 100

max resample = 5

3. When a point is outside of bounds, use a projection to map $(-\infty,\infty)$ to $[lb,ub]$ (裴季源)

TODO

4. Use mutation step-size to adjust lower bounds for $\eta$ (欧阳奕成)

TODO

5. Mutate $\eta$ first then mutate $\x$ (赵志翔)

TODO

6. Generate 2 offspring using Cauchy and Gaussian, take the fitter one (IFEP) (张清泉)

 **Attention: You will use more evaluations if fixing the same number of generations!**

running times = 10

7. Use mean mutation operator (吴钰)

experiment times = 10

population size = 50

initilize all eta = 0.1

8. Use adaptive mutation operator (潘超)
